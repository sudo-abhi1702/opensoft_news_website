                        <b>Civil rights</b> activists urged the government on Saturday to restore Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution and take steps to bring back normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir.
                        <p>Social activist Shabnam Hashmi said the abrogation of Article 370, which gave a special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was a mindless exercise carried out by the BJP-led government.</p>

                        <p>The activists urged the government to restore Articles 370 and 35A, mobile and internet services and remove the restrictions on the movement of people in the vall </p>
